- 👀 I’m interested in biostatistics, machine learning for healthcare application, and population health. 
- 🌱 I’m currently pivoting to dissertation work combining census and CDC datasets to assess the relationship betweeen Internet adoption and diabetes prevalence in US Counties. Repo will be public after defense in April 2024.
